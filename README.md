# whatsappbot
I maintain an ubuntu home server, and made a Whatsapp Chatbot for it just for fun.

It makes life easier! My server and me are 10000 miles away (Jakarta, Indonesia vs. Los Angeles, CA).
Having to SSH/teleport all the time is a pain.



# What does it do?

- monitoring of resources e.g. CPU, RAM
- ```systemctl status```
- ```ps aux | grep``` 
- customized warnings - I like to use a cli tool for this so that I can issue a message from one command.
- use for reminders in crontab - e.g. letsencrypt certificate expiration
- run custom build scripts (bash scripts) to run deploys / app builds. (build scripts are already predefined inside), and print stdout of results as they come in batches.
- ip/networking (Dynamic IPs, etc.)
